<!-- Single page applications where different views, most of the UI are all handled on the same page. Page contains all the views for the app, loading from the Node API. React sends AJAX call to the Node API, gets or posts information to a database, database sends back an object to the Node API, then returns a JSON object to React.   -->

    <!-- Much minimized page refreshes with a SPA as multiple views are loaded on to one page. examples: FB, twitter, gmail.  -->

    <!-- React purpose: fast, scalable and simple. -->
    <!-- 1. Declarative: easier to add interactive UI's. Design simple views for each state of the application. React efficiently updates and renders correct components when data changes. Makes code more predictable and easier to debug. -->

    <!-- 2. component-based: manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UI's. JS logic instead of templates, pass data through app and keep out of the DOM. -->

    <!-- 3. JSX - use HTML quoting, and HTML tags to render subcomponents.  -->

    <!-- single way data flow: properties flow down, actions flow up. -->
